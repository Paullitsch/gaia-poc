# 2026-02-19 — GAIA Phase 7 Breakthrough

## Deadlock Fix & Infrastructure
- Fixed server RwLock deadlock (never hold multiple locks simultaneously)
- Fixed worker: numpy JSON serialization, max_evals from params, --no-plots
- Docker Compose: server + CPU worker in one command
- Dashboard: tabs (Overview/Charts/Export), 4 interactive charts, data export
- v0.2.1 released on GitHub with Linux + Windows binaries

## Phase 7 Results (100K evaluations on RTX 5070)
- **Curriculum: +274.0** — SOLVED! 🏆
- **CMA-ES: +235.3** — SOLVED!
- **OpenAI-ES: +206.6** — SOLVED!
- **Indirect Encoding: -9.4** — not solved (still running)
- **Hybrid CMA+FF: FAILED** — shape mismatch bug in forward-forward layer

**3 out of 5 gradient-free methods solved LunarLander (>200)!**
This proves the core GAIA thesis: gradient-free optimization CAN solve RL tasks.

## Key Insight
Pure evolutionary methods (CMA-ES, OpenAI-ES, Curriculum) work.
The "local learning" hybrid approaches need more work.
Compute matters enormously — 100K evals vs 2K evals was the difference.
